- $5,000 upon completion of authentication and payment systems (milestone 2)
- $5,000 upon final delivery and acceptance (milestone 3)

Contractor grants Client a perpetual license to use any pre-existing materials incorporated into the deliverables.

Major scope changes require a written change order and may result in adjusted timeline and compensation.

5. TIMELINE
Estimated project completion: 8 weeks from start date. Timeline may be extended due to:

- Scope changes
- Force majeure events

- Client must pay for all completed milestones
- Client must pay for work-in-progress at the hourly rate of $100/hour
- Contractor will deliver all completed work

During the project term only, Contractor agrees not to work on directly competing products (defined as mobile apps in the same market category with substantially similar core features). This restriction expires immediately upon project completion.

12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
